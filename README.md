## About

This is the client for a real-time game. It features a lobby where players (users who are logged in) can create and join games. The game is a simple guessing game: a blurred image appears on the screen and players have to guess what animal it is before the timer runs out. The player who guesses right first wins.

The main things we learned from this project was to work with real-time socket.io connections. We also got a lot more familiar with React-Redux while working on it.
